					<p><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a> is the most trusted leak organization on the planet. It is constantly publishing new submissions from whistleblowers, activist groups, and others to bring the truth to light. This hard work involves thousands of hours of human labor, and we need your help to continue to operate. <span class="highlight">DDoSecrets has published over 250 datasets from more than 50 countries, adding up to nearly 100 terabytes</span>. Our library reveals the inner workings of oligarchs' finances, fascist organizations, shell companies, tax havens, banks, law enforcement, military, and political groups from all over the world.</p>

						<h3>Where Does Your Support Go?</h3>
						<p>While DDoSecrets' expenses have increased, we remain an efficient, barebones operation. We are sometimes called a successor to WikiLeaks, but for comparison, in 2010, WikiLeaks needed "$10,000 to 15,000 a month to maintain its Web presence," $200,000 a year to cover its operating expenses, and more than half a million dollars to pay a small staff. With a fraction of that budget, DDoSecrets has made more than 10,000 times the amount of data available.</p>

					<h3>This Work Comes with Significant Risk</h3>
					<p>After we published BlueLeaks, a large cache of files from over 200 U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence fusion centers, German authorities seized the server for DDoSecrets’ search system at the request of the FBI. The German prosecutor acted despite having no official paperwork and knowing DDoSecrets was a journalist group. At the same time, many of our accounts have been banned or suspended from social media. (To this day, you can’t Tweet any DDoSecrets.com web addresses except this one 😼.)</p>
					<p>We never bowed to pressure or stopped publishing. We debunked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's labeling of us "criminal hackers." Despite the censorship, our library continues to impact public debate. For example, the Parler videos we published were used as evidence during the second impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.</p>

					<h3>Your Contributions Help Us Fight</h3>
					<p>DDoSecrets can't do this work alone. We've partnered with groups like Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, European Investigative Collaborations, the Henri-Nannen-Journalistenschule journalism school, and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. During the Russo-Ukrainian War, we became known as one of the best public repositories for Russian files allowing the public an unheard-of behind-the-scenes of Russian censorship and propaganda as well as the inner workings of some of its now-sanctioned industries.</p>
					<p>Although some of our data is available for search in a custom search engine, we want to rebuild the Hunter Memorial Library to restore public access to the world's largest searchable archive of secrets. Rebuilding the Hunter Memorial Library is an important project to provide a safe, stable, and accessible platform for the public, researchers, and journalists to dig deep into previously secret data.</p>
					<p>DDoSecrets has always been a global project. Accessibility for all languages in the archive has never been more critical. We've completed the first translation of our website into Russian, and we want to add more languages.</p>
